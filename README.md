# A Detailed Guide to Creating a Mental Health Diagnostic System with OpenAI GPT-3 and Supabase

## I. Scientific Foundation

### 1.1 Mental Health and Its Importance

Mental health is a crucial aspect of overall health and wellbeing. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and can contribute to his or her community[^1^].

### 1.2 Mental Health Screening Tools

Screening tools are instruments that can be used to identify potential mental health disorders. Examples include the "Emulated Initial Screening Questionnaire for Mental Health", the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). These tools typically consist of a series of questions that aim to quantify the severity of symptoms[^2^].

## II. Technical Premise

### 2.1 OpenAI's GPT-3

OpenAI's GPT-3 is a powerful language model capable of understanding and generating human-like text. It can be used to construct conversational AI interfaces such as chatbots[^3^].

### 2.2 Supabase

Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, providing backend services like real-time databases, authentication, and storage. It can be used for storing and managing user responses and scoring[^4^].

## III. Implementation

### 3.1 User Starts the Conversation

The user initiates the conversation with the chatbot, which is powered by GPT-3.

### 3.2 Initial Screening

The chatbot presents the "Emulated Initial Screening Questionnaire for Mental Health". The user's responses are recorded in the chat history and stored using Supabase.

### 3.3 Scoring and Decision Making

The responses from the initial screening questionnaire are scored, and the appropriate test (GAD-7, BDI, or STAI) is determined based on the user's score. Below is an explanation of each test, what it assesses, and how to interpret its results:

1. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7):** GAD-7 is a self-reported questionnaire for screening and severity measuring of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It consists of seven questions that measure the severity of various signs of GAD according to reported response categories with assigned points. The total score for GAD-7 ranges from 0 to 21. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cut points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively. While the GAD-7 does not provide a definitive diagnosis, a high score can suggest the presence of GAD[^5^].

2. **Beck Depression Inventory (BDI):** The BDI is a 21-item self-report rating inventory measuring characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression[^6^]. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. Total scores can range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. The scores are usually divided into minimal range (0-13), mild depression (14-19), moderate depression (20-28), and severe depression (29-63).

3. **State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI):** The STAI measures two types of anxiety – state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and trait anxiety, or anxiety as a personal characteristic. Higher scores are positively correlated with higher levels of anxiety. It consists of 40 questions on a self-report basis. Scores range from 20-80, with higher scores correlating to greater anxiety[^7^].

### 3.4 Test Administration

The solution administers the chosen test to the user. The questions are fetched from the backend database using Supabase, and the user's responses are stored.

### 3.5 Scoring, Diagnosis, and Next Steps

Once the user completes the test, the responses are scored, and a diagnosis is generated. Depending on the results out AI can offer preventive support all the way to suggest and facilitate intervention of a mental health professional.
